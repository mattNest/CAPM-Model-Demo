# CAPM-Python-Demo
We use Data of Apple and SPY to illustrate CAPM ( Capital Asset Pricing Model )
<br> Here are the problems we would like to find out: 
1. What is the relationship b/w an individual stock v.s. SPY Index?
2. How to prove CAPM is actually right? (By create noise and fake_stock exmaple)
